# V Gene Chi-Square Analysis

"""
This script is designed to analyze the distribution of V gene usage across different disease stages. It performs the following tasks:
1. Counts V genes in various samples and associates them with disease stages based on metadata.
2. Visualizes the distribution of V genes by disease stage using a grouped bar plot.
3. Performs a Chi-Square test to determine if there is a statistically significant association between V gene usage and disease stage.
4. Calculates standardized residuals to identify specific V genes and disease stages that contribute most to any observed association.
5. Visualizes these residuals in a heatmap to help identify patterns of over- or under-representation of V genes in specific disease stages.

The insights gained from this analysis are important for understanding how immune response characteristics, such as V gene usage, vary with disease progression, and may provide clues for targeted therapeutic interventions.

Input File Descriptions:
1. metadata_Disease_ETC.csv: This file should be a CSV containing metadata for the samples. It must include the following columns:
   - 'sample_id': A unique identifier for each sample.
   - 'disease_stage': The disease stage for each sample.

2. SEA.txt: This file should be a tab-separated file containing V gene usage data for each sample. It must include the following columns:
   - 'sample_id': A unique identifier for each sample (matching the metadata file).
   - 'V': The V gene used by each sequence in the sample.

These input files are essential for linking V gene usage to disease progression and enabling the statistical analysis performed in this script.

This helps in identifying which specific observations deviate significantly from the expected frequency, providing insights into patterns that may be biologically relevant.
